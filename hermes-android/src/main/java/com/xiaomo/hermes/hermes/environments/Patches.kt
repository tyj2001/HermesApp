/**
 * Monkey patches for making hermes-agent tools work inside async frameworks (Atropos).
 *
 * Problem:
 *     Some tools use asyncio.run() internally (e.g., Modal backend via SWE-ReX,
 *     web_extract). This crashes when called from inside Atropos's event loop because
 *     asyncio.run() can't be nested.
 *
 * Solution:
 *     The Modal environment (tools/environments/modal.py) now uses a dedicated
 *     _AsyncWorker thread internally, making it safe for both CLI and Atropos use.
 *     No monkey-patching is required.
 *
 *     This module is kept for backward compatibility. applyPatches() is a no-op.
 *
 * Usage:
 *     Call applyPatches() once at import time (done automatically by hermes_base_env.py).
 *     This is idempotent and safe to call multiple times.
